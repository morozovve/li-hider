# li-hider v0.1

### What is it?
Chrome extension for hiding LinkedIn jobs from specific company.

### Why do I (or maybe you) need it?
Default LinkedIn interface allows to hide only specific job, one at a time. <br>
But what if you constantly see company whose values don't align with yours?<br>
Or what if some company strictly requires knowledge of a local language and you are from another country?<br>
What if it is the company that develops chat-bots, but you are looking for some HFT positions?<br><br>
Search might be imperfect sometimes, that's why I wrote this simple Chrome extension :)

### Current features
- [x] Injects "Hide" button for every job in LinkedIn search
- [x] Show amount of jobs that were hidden by this extension
- [x] Provides with the list of companies which you hid, new-to-old
- [x] Includes easy and clean interface for removing those companies from "Hidden list"

### Future features
- [ ] Less ugly pop-up interface
- [ ] Ability to filter list of hidden jobs (e.g. by name / location)
- [ ] Include more info (e.g. add company's country, some custom comments, etc.)
- [ ] Being able to quickly check jobs from what companies were hidden (probably in the pop-up, idk yet)

### Sidenote
This is my first project on JS (so it's far from  and it is designed to ease my life specifically. <br>
Due to that, it:
- is imperfect
- has far from exemplary quality of both JS and HTML code
- might bug/not work in other browsers / conditions / moon phases <br>

But hey, it works for me :)  <br>
And if you somehow found this repo and in need of tool like this, don't hesitate to check this out and maybe even open some issues!
